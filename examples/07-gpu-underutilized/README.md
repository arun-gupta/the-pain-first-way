# Pain 7 example: the same traffic, three layers of improvement

A working demonstration of [Pain 7: My GPU sits at 30% but my bill says 100%](../../pains/07-gpu-underutilized.md). Same inference server, same simulated workload, three independent improvements applied one at a time. No GPU required.

```

No GPU required. All GPU behavior is simulated with `time.sleep`. The cloud-native concepts are identical to a real vLLM deployment.

## The point of the diff

`before/server.py` shows the problem: requests process one at a time, GPU idle between them. Five concurrent requests take ~2.5s wall time. CPU stays at 5% so Kubernetes HPA never triggers.

`before/optimization-steps.md` shows what ML practitioners do first — before touching infrastructure. Two tracks: Mac path using ollama (no GPU required — runnable today on Apple Silicon) and GPU path using vLLM (production reference). Covers continuous batching, quantization, prefix caching, speculative decoding, sequence packing, and prefill/decode disaggregation.

`after/server.py` simulates a batching-aware engine: up to `MAX_CONCURRENT` requests run in parallel, five concurrent requests take ~0.5s regardless of count, and `/metrics` exposes `inference_requests_in_flight` so the autoscaler watches the right signal.

`after/scaledobject.yaml` configures KEDA to add replicas when `inference_requests_in_flight` exceeds 3. `after/mig-config.yaml` shows how to partition a physical GPU into isolated slices via the GPU Operator so multiple workloads can share one card.

Each layer is independent. `optimization-steps.md` needs no infrastructure. Step 1 is a server swap. Steps 2 and 3 add infrastructure only when you need it.

## Run it

- [`before/README.md`](before/README.md) — run the sequential server, observe serialization, review vLLM pre-CN optimizations
- [`after/README.md`](after/README.md) — Step 1: run the batching server, observe parallelism and metrics; Step 2: apply KEDA; Step 3: configure MIG
